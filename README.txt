Creating Gates

To begin, we must first make gates.
The gates are mapped to the following number keys:

1. Or
   Creates an or gate with two inputs and one output.
   The output is on if one of the inputs is on.

2. On
   Creates an on signal with one output.

3. Off
   Creates an off signal with one output.

4. Button
   Creates a button which can be toggled by (Control +
   Left Clicking).

5. Xor
   Creates an xor gate with two inputs and one output.
   The output is on if one input is on, but not both.

6. Bulb
   Creates a bulb with one input which lights when on.

7. Not
   Creates a not gate with one input and one output.
   The output is the inverse of the input.

8. Link
   Creates a linking gate with one input and one output.
   The output is the same as the input.

9 - 0. And
   Creates an and gate with two inputs and one output.
   The output is on if both inputs are on.

Wiring Gates

In order to wire gates, you must first (Right Click) on the
input you want to wire. If the gate has two inputs, you
must (Right Click) on the one you want. After the input has
been linked, you will see a yellow line linking the mouse
to the input.

After an input has been selected, (Right Click) on another
gate's output to wire the two together. The wire will lay
itself on the field once it has been placed.

Removing Gates

In order to remove a gate, (Shift + Right Click) on it.

Extra Features

While moving a gate, if (Shift) is held, the gate will snap
to a 16x16 grid.
